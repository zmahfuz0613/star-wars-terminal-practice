# 1. In THIS directory, create a new directory called star_wars. > Example answer: mkdir star_wars
mkdir star_wars
# 2. In two commands, in the star_wars folder, create two new directories: empire and rebellion. IN THAT ORDER!!!


# 3. Inside the empire directory, create a file called darth_vader.

# 4. Use the force (or your echo) to add the text ...heavy breathing... to the darth_vader file. (Don’t remember how to do this? Use the ‘other force’, known as Google!)

# 5. Inside the empire directory, create a file called emperor_palpatine.

# 6. Inside the empire directory, create a directory called death_star.

# 7. Move darth_vader into the death_star.
